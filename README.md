Have you ever wanted to store energy with Create: New Age but don't want to add other mods that add lots of other junk?

Then this is the mod for you!

Tiers:

This mod adds two battery tiers lithium ion and nickel cadmium, with a creative battery that just has infinite energy.

Lithium Ion:

Can hold up to 1,200,000 FE.

Batteries are made using a copper sheet, an ionic lithuim ingot, a graphite, and then pressed.

Repeat 6 times:

You then use the batteries to make battery packs:

And then battery packs to make the lithium ion accumulator block:

Nickel Cadmium:

Can hold up to 600,000 FE.

Batteries are made using a copper sheet, a nickel, a corium, and then pressed.

Repeat 6 times:

You then use the batteries to make battery packs:

And then battery packs to make the nickel cadmium accumulator block:

Creative:

Holds âˆž FE.

All accumulators automatically push FE to the block above them. This means towers of accumulators will always push FE to the top accumulator, and thus it is best to extract from the top accumulator and to push into the bottom one.
